# Hateful-Meme-Analyzer-
-Utilized YOLOv8 to classify and catalog objects within memes, enabling detailed content analysis.
-Conducted a comprehensive analysis of existing uni-modal methods(Random Forest, Decision Trees, etc.) for
hateful meme classification, comparing their performance and accuracy.
-Developed and implemented a multi-modal model using RNNs to try to improve classification accuracy by
integrating text and image data.
-Evaluated model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust and reliable
classification results.
